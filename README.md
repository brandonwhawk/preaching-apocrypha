# preaching-apocrypha
This repository includes data sets used for chapter one of my book Preaching Apocrypha in Anglo-Saxon England.

In chapter one, I discuss a large network of interrelated apocryphal preaching texts included in dozens of manuscripts: Latin homiliaries with Anglo-Saxon associations from the Continent and England, as well as collections of Old English sermons. Throughout the chapter, I present data about surviving manuscripts containing apocrypha and a number of visualizations for the network and relationships I discuss. This work rests on two data sets, included here.
For more about the book and the context of these data sets, visit https://brandonwhawk.net/preaching-apocrypha/.

Data here includes two sets (both in .csv and .xlsx):
1) Data about “Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon Scripts in CLA” (obtained using Mark Stansbury’s Earlier Latin Manuscripts, at NUI Galway).
2) Data about “Apocrypha in Anglo-Saxon Preaching Collections” used for network visualizations (visualizations created using Palladio).
