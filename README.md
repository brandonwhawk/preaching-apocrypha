# preaching-apocrypha
Data sets used for chapter 1 of my book Preaching Apocrypha in Anglo-Saxon England
In chapter one, I discuss a large network of interrelated apocryphal preaching texts included in dozens of manuscripts: Latin homiliaries with Anglo-Saxon associations from the Continent and England, as well as collections of Old English sermons. Throughout the chapter, I present data about surviving manuscripts containing apocrypha and a number of visualizations for the network and relationships I discuss. This work rests on two data sets, included here.
